# Python Test-Driven Development Project

This project is a collection of Python tasks designed to promote test-driven development (TDD). Each task is aimed at building a solid understanding of TDD principles, Python programming, and writing efficient code.

## Integers Addition

Write a function that adds two integers. It must raise a TypeError exception if the inputs are not integers or floats and cast them to integers if they are floats.

## Divide a Matrix

Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix by a given number. The function should return a new matrix with elements divided by the specified number, rounded to 2 decimal places. It handles various exceptions for input validation.

## Say My Name

Write a function that prints a name with a given first name and last name. It raises a TypeError exception if the inputs are not strings.

## Print Square

Create a function to print a square of '#' characters of a specified size. The function handles input validation and raises exceptions accordingly.

## Text Indentation

Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after '.', '?', and ':' characters. It raises a TypeError exception if the input is not a string.

## Max Integer - Unittest

This task focuses on writing unittests for a `max_integer` function. It demonstrates how to use the `unittest` module to test a function. The tests should pass successfully for the provided function.
